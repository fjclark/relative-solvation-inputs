Vacuum input files can be found at
`/SIMS/relative_split_protocol/relative_processes/*process*/` 
solvated input files: 
`/SIMS/relative_split_protocol/relative_processes/*process*/solvated`.

Solvated simulations should be run using mdp files inside
`/SIMS/relative_split_protocol/mdp_files/../*charge_method_acronym*`

Vacuum simulations should be run using mdp files inside
`SIMS/relative_split_protocol/mdp_files/../VACUUM`

Soft-core Coulomb is set not to be used.
