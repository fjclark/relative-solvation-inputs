Vacuum input files can be found at
`/SIMS/relative_unified_protocol/relative_processes/*process*/` 
solvated input files: 
`/SIMS/relative_unified_protocol/relative_processes/*process*/solvated`.

Solvated simulations should be run using mdp files inside
`/SIMS/mdp_files/relative_unified_protocol/*charge_method_acronym*`

Vacuum simulations should be run using mdp files inside
`/SIMS/mdp_files/relative_unified_protocol/VACUUM`
