Input files for absolute free energy calculations in Sire/SOMD

Each folder has:

*free:  folder with water phase input files:
    * input: here the following files can be found:
        * SYSTEM.top : topology of the system of interest
        * SYSTEM.crd : coordinate file of the system of interest
        * MORPH.pert.discharge: MORPH file for the discharging step
        * MORPH.pert.vanish   : MORPH file for the vanishing step
        * sim.cfg    : configuration file to run a simulation in Sire/SOMD
    * discharge: output folder for the discharging step:
        * FUNC.py : python script to postprocess the trajectory and extract the 
                    DG_func term, as described in the paper
        * coulcor.sh: bash script to automatically run FUNC.py in Sire/SOMD
    * vanish:  output folder for the vanishing step:
        * ljcor.sh: bash script to automatically run the Sire/SOMD Lennard-Jones
                    long range corrections

*vacuum: folder for the vacuum phase:
    * input: here the following files can be found:
        * SYSTEM.top : topology of the system of interest
        * SYSTEM.crd : coordinate file of the system of interset
        * MORPH.pert.discharge: MORPH file for the discharging step
        * MORPH.pert.vanish   : MORPH file for the vanishing step
        * sim.cfg : configuration file to run a simulation in Sire/SOMD
    * discharge: output folder for the discharging step
    * vanish: output folder for the vanishin step

To extract the postprocess correction term, DG_func and DG_ljcor, after all the lambda
windows have been run:

```
cd discharge/
bash coulcor.sh

cd ../vanish/
bash ljcor_work.sh
```

```coulcor.sh``` will create:
*freenrg-COULCOR.dat: DG_func correction term

```ljcor_work.sh``` will create two files:
*freenrg-LJCOR-lam-1.000.dat : LJ correction at lambda = 1.0
*freenrg-LJCOR-lam-0.000.dat : LJ correction at lambda = 0.0

(Remember DG_LJCOR = (LJ correction at lambda 1.0 ) - (LJ correction at lambda 0.0) )
