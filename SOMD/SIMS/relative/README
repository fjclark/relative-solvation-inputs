Input files for relative free energy calculations in Sire/SOMD

Each folder has:

*free:  folder with water phase input files:
    * input: here the following files can be found:
        * SYSTEM.top : topology of the system of interest
        * SYSTEM.crd : coordinate file of the system of interest
        * MORPH.pert : MORPH file to perturb the dummy atoms
        * sim.cfg    : configuration file to run a simulation in Sire/SOMD
    * output: output folder:
        * FUNC_0.py  : python script to postprocess the trajectory and extract the 
                       DG_func term at lambda = 0.0
        * FUNC_1.py  : python script to postprocess the trajectory and extract the
                       DG_func term at lambda = 1.0 
        * coulcor.sh : bash script to automatically run FUNC_0.py and FUNC_1.py in Sire/SOMD
        * ljcor_work.sh: bash script to automatically run the Lennard Jones long range correction
                       in Sire/SOMD

*vacuum: folder for the vacuum phase:
    * input: here the following files can be found:
        * SYSTEM.top : topology of the system of interest
        * SYSTEM.crd : coordinate file of the system of interset
        * MORPH.pert : MORPH file to perturb the dummy atoms
        * sim.cfg    : configuration file to run a simulation in Sire/SOMD
    * output: output folder

To extract the postprocess correction term, DG_func and DG_ljcor, after all the lambda
windows have been run:

```
cd output/
bash coulcor.sh
bash ljcor_work.sh
```

```coulcor.sh``` will produce two files:
*freenrg-COULCOR-lam-1.0000.dat: DG_func term at lambda = 1.0
*freenrg-COULCOR-lam-0.0000.dat: DG_func term at lambda = 0.0

(Remember DG_func = (DG_func at lambda 1.0) - (DG_func at lambda 0.0) )

```ljcor_work.sh``` will create two files:
*freenrg-LJCOR-lam-1.000.dat : LJ correction at lambda = 1.0
*freenrg-LJCOR-lam-0.000.dat : LJ correction at lambda = 0.0

(Remember DG_LJCOR = (LJ correction at lambda 1.0 ) - (LJ correction at lambda 0.0) )
